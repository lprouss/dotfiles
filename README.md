Dotfiles
========

This repo contains the dotfiles for my laptop running Debian testing with the [i3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/).

The Bash script `installDotfiles.sh` is also included to copy the dotfiles to a new system (read the documentation in the file).

This repo currently includes dotfiles for:

+ startup scripts: `profile`, `xsessionrc`
+ `i3` and `i3status`
+ `bash`, including `aliases` and `dircolors`
+ `readline`, via `inputrc`
+ `vim`, with several plugins managed using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
+ `git`, including a global `gitignore` file
+ `urxvt`, using `Xresources` with a [Solarized Dark color theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
+ `latexmkrc`
+ `mplayer`
+ `htop`

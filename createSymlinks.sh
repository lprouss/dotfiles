# Small script to create symlinks into the user's home directory for
# dotfiles (and dot directories) located in a input directory (DOTDIR).
# The script will ignore dotfiles and directories located in the directory
# DOTDIR/ignore.
# The dotfiles and directories being replaced are copied in a backup
# directory (by default: "DOTDIR/backup").
